Tasks

Configure R3 according to the topology to achieve these results:

1. Configure eBGP using Loopback 0 for the router-id. Do not use the address-family
   command to accomplish this.
2. Advertise R3’s Loopback 100 and Loopback 200 networks to AS110 and AS120.

end



Task 1. Configure eBGP using Loopback 0 for the router-id.
Do not use the address-family command to accomplish this.
 
Please check the IP address of the Loopback0 interface with 
the command “show ip int brief”. Suppose it is 10.3.3.3 in this case.

config t
R3:
config t
router bgp 130
 bgp router-id 10.3.3.3

 neighbor 209.165.200.230 remote-as 120
 network 209.165.201.5 mask 255.255.255.255
 network 209.165.201.15 mask 255.255.255.255

Task 2. Advertise R3’s Loopback 100 and Loopback 200 networks to AS110 and AS120.

Please check the IP addresses and subnet masks of Lo100 (209.165.203.1/32) & Lo200 (200.200.203.2/32)
 interfaces carefully to match with the “network” commands below.
 Suppose in this case the subnet masks of Lo100 & Lo200 IPs both are /32:
 
config t
R3 (under "router bgp 130"):
 network 209.165.201.5 mask 255.255.255.255
 network 209.165.201.15 mask 255.255.255.255
 
Verification

Check on R1, R2 to see if they have the IP addresses of Lo100 & Lo200 interfaces of R3
in their routing table
with the “show ip route bgp” (or “show ip route” or “show ip bgp”) command.

-> If the “State/PfxRcd” field has a number then BGP relationship is up.

I got a version of this SIM today. My AS’s were different, and it was R1 to be configured 
(the other router 2 and 3 were already fully configured for eBGP. My config was something like this

NOTE: in your exam, it can be R1 or R2:


EXAMQUESTIONS2:

Tasks:

The operations team started configuring network devices for a new site. 
Complete the configurations to achieve these goals:

1. Configure Rapid PVST+ on SW20.

2. The trunk between SW20 and SW30 is not operational. 
Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.

3. The LACP port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational. 
Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC2 (10.10.100.20) across the port channel.

Note: No access is provided to SW10 or SW30. Resolve these issues by making 
changes only to SW20. Traffic on all trunks should be restricted to only active VLANs.

Task 1. Configure Rapid PVST+ on SW20.

On SW20:

SW20#conf t
SW20(config)#spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst

Task 2. The trunk between SW20 and SW30 is not operational. Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping PC1 (10.10.100.10) across the link.

SW20(config)#interface e0/0
SW20(config-if)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW20(config-if)#switchport mode trunk

Verification

Open PC3 and try pinging to PC1 (you have to wait for about 1 minute before the ping can work):

PC3#ping 10.10.100.10
!!!!!

Task 3. The LACP port channel between SW10 and SW20 is not operational.
 Troubleshoot the issue and ensure PC3 can ping
 PC2 (10.10.100.20) across the port channel.
 
Use the “show etherchannel summary” command on SW20 to check the issue. 
Maybe both Etherchannel interfaces were not configured anything or set to passive
 or use PAgP instead (with “desirable” or “auto” mode).
 Therefore we must change to “active” mode.
 
Use the “show run” command on SW20 to check if there is a preconfigured Port-channel
 interface or not. If there is then we must use this port-channel number for our config.
 Suppose 
there is a preconfigured “interface Port-channel 10”
 so we need to use the “channel-group 10 …” command:
 
//Please check the channel-group number carefully. We suppose it is 10 here.
SW20(config)#int range e0/2 - 3
SW20(config-if-range)#channel-group 10 mode active

Note: If we see this error:

%EC-5-CANNOT_BUNDLE2: Et0/2 is not compatible with Po10 and will be suspended 
(trunk encap of Et0/2 is auto, Po10 is dot1q)
%EC-5-CANNOT_BUNDLE2: Et0/3 is not compatible with Po10 and will be suspended
 (trunk encap of Et0/3 is auto, Po10 is dot1q)
The cause of this error is Po10 is created before grouping e0/2 & e0/2 so we must make sure our physical interfaces are compatible 
with Po10. We need two additional commands:

SW20(config)#int range e0/2 - 3
SW20(config-if-range)#switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
SW20(config-if-range)#switchport mode trunk

If the Po10 interface is still not up then please check if Po10
 has any other commands that E0/2 – 3 interfaces do not have. We may need another command:

SW20(config-if-range)#switchport trunk allowed vlan 500
if this command exists on Po10.

Verification

Maybe we should shutdown the e0/0 interface of SW20 to make sure the ping goes through the port channel:

SW20(config)#int e0/0
SW20(config-if)#shut

PC3#ping 10.10.100.20
!!!!!

Then “no shut” e0/0 (suppose we are under int 0/0 of SW20 already):

SW20(config-if)#no shut

Save the configuration:

Tasks

Protect R1 config to achieve the following 3 results:

1. local database is configured for the user “SuperAdmin” with pass “SuperUser” and with highest privilege
2. the vty interfaces utilize the local user database for access and allow Telnet and SSH
3. Virtual terminal Exec sessions should timeout after 5 minutes of inactivity


Solution

Task 1. local database is configured for the user “SuperAdmin” with pass “SuperUser” and with highest privilege

R1(config)#username SuperAdmin privilege 15 password SuperUser
Task 2. the vty interfaces utilize the local user database for access and allow Telnet and SSH + Task 3. Virtual terminal Exec sessions should timeout after 5 minutes of inactivity

R1:

line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input telnet ssh
 exec-timeout 5 0 //syntax: exec-timeout {minutes} {seconds}
Verification

Try to telnet to R1 from R2 or R3 (suppose 192.168.100.1 is an IP address of the interface that is connected to the switch on R1. Please use the “show ip interface brief” on R1 to find out this IP address):

On R2:
R2#192.168.100.1
Trying 192.168.100.1 …Open
User Access Verification
Username: SuperAdmin //Type “SuperAdmin” here
Password: ********* //Type “SuperUser” here

R1# -> login successful

Save the configuration

Tasks

The Operations team started configuring several monitoring activities. Complete the configurations for the tasks below.

1. Complete the Flexible NetFlow Flow Exporter configuration on R1 to send data to the collector using UDP port 2055.
2. Configure the switch port analyzer on Sw1 and mirror all communication to and from PC1 to interface E1/1 using session number 11.
3. Schedule the pre-configured IP SLA operation on R1 to start running immediately and to run indefinitely.

Topology; See NetflowLab

Solution

Note: All the parameters (port, IP addresses, session number, IP SLA number…) may be different so please check them carefully.

Task 1. Complete the Flexible NetFlow Flow Exporter configuration on R1 to send data to the collector using UDP port 2055.

We should use “show run” command to check if there is any existed Flow Exporter or not. If not we can define any name for it. 

Suppose the name of the Flow Exporter here is “MyFlowExporter”.

We are not sure the IP address of NetFlow Collector. If we can access Sw1, use “show run” command to check if we can find it. 

Suppose the NetFlow Collector here is PC2 with IP address 10.14.1.2. We will use it in “destination” command below:

On R1:

flow exporter MyFlowExporter
 destination 10.14.1.2
 transport udp 2055
 export-protocol netflow-v9
 
 
Task 2. Configure the switch port analyzer on Sw1 and mirror all communication to and from 

PC1 to interface E1/1 using session number 11.

PC1 is on interface e0/1 of the switch so we will monitor this interface:

On Sw1:

monitor session 11 source interface e0/1 both
monitor session 11 destination interface e1/1


Task 3. Schedule the pre-configured IP SLA operation on R1 to start running immediately and to run indefinitely.

First we need to find out the IP SLA number which was preconfigured with “show run” command.

R1#show run
...
ip sla 5
...


Suppose the IP SLA number we found is 5. We will use this number in the next command.

On Sw1:

Sw1(config)#ip sla schedule 5 life forever start-time now
